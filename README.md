# Crazy-Universe
It is a project about 3D rendering written in Open-GL, which bases on knowledge from computer graphic(Phong Illumination, ray tracing and so on). To see dynamic effects please vist at:https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XlccRB

In this project, we have used ray tracing to show different objects such as sphere and plane. Meanwhile, we have used Phong Illumination to simulate the a little bit complex light effects. To make the universe more real and more diverse, we use two famous shader and projected them to three planes and one sphere.

This project was finished at NUS by our group. Especially thanks to: Zhang Wanyu, Li Yunshang and Zhu Fuzhu.
